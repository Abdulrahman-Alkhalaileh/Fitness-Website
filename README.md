# Fitness-Website
My final project for bachelor degree at the collage, it's a full stack website with alot of technologies used to develop.

I didn't upload a database because it's local, so you should make one yourself.
use phpMyAdmin and make a database named minefitness with three tables( cart, users, store).
you can get attributes name from the file backend.js and from the .js files at directory named routers.
enjoy :) <3
