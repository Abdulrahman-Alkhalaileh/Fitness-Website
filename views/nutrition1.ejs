              The results show a number of daily calorie estimates that can be
              used as a guideline for how many calories to consume each day to
              maintain, lose, or gain weight at a chosen rate.
            </h3>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <h3>
              You can use this information to help you figure out how many
              calories you should be consuming to maintain your weight. On
              active days, you'll need more calories, so it's okay to eat a
              little more than you would on an average day. But on more
              sedentary days, you may want to reduce your calorie intake.
              <br /><br />
              If you want to lose weight, try to stay below your calorie needs
              or increase your activity level. However, make sure you are eating
              nutritious meals and not restricting your calories too much -
              eating too little or losing weight rapidly can be unhealthy and
              dangerous.
